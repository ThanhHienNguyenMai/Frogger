We wrote our file with the GPIO-V1.1 file posted in the project section of D2L so the make file we are submitting was the one provided in that file.

To run our file you will just need to navigate to the appropriate place where you end up extracting the file, run the command "make" and then run "./myProg"

The reason we manually reset the button pressed to 0 multiple times is to prevent 1 button pressed from being processed multiple times
